		<p>Hello world!</p>
		<p>I am going to be looking at the perception of performative activism for college 
			students in the downtown Portland area, specifically focusing on Portland State University students. 
			During the protests of the murder of George Floyd, there was an influx of people publically 
			supporting the cause but only for attention and, in some cases, to avoid ridicule for not speaking
			up. This happens on a personal level and at the corporate level, with brands posting similar smokescreen 
			calls for justice and equality. It is significant to understand how these impact true activism, and where 
			the line is.
